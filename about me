ABOUT ME
My name is Ava Mahboubi .I’m 20 years old .One of my best hobby is reading book and news , watch educational movies and exercise .I grew up in Iran then I moved out to Canada with my family .The reason that I moved out to Canada is continue education and try to improve my life style.
 I’m a respolsible and hard worker person, in me opinion one of the most important keys to success is having the disclipline to do what you know you should do even when you don’t feel like doing it—and those dialy decision often involve taking responsibility for your own choise and action.
